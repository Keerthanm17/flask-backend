# üé§ gTTS Flask Backend Microservice

A lightweight and robust Flask-based microservice for **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** generation using the popular `gTTS` library (Google Text-to-Speech). This backend is designed to handle multilingual audio generation, supporting a variety of Indian languages, and can be easily integrated into larger projects for text-to-audio conversion.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multilingual Support:** Supports several languages including Hindi (`hi`), Kannada (`kn`), Telugu (`te`), Tamil (`ta`), Marathi (`mr`), Gujarati (`gu`), Bengali (`bn`), Punjabi (`pa`), Odia (`or`), and English (`en`).
* **Simple REST API:** Provides a clean `/tts` endpoint for generating audio files.
* **CORS Enabled:** Configured with `Flask-CORS` to allow requests from any frontend application.
* **Health Check:** Includes a `/health` endpoint for monitoring service status.
* **Language Listing:** A `/languages` endpoint to easily retrieve all supported language codes.
* **Ephemeral Storage:** Generates and serves MP3 files from a temporary directory, ensuring a clean and stateless service.
